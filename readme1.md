# Resume vs Job Description Analyzer

A smart AI-powered tool that analyzes a job description and provides a breakdown of key 
requirements such as technical skills, soft skills, experience, and more. This tool is 
intended to help job seekers quickly understand how well a job fits their profile and what 
they need to improve in their resumes.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This app leverages the power of [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) and OpenAI's 
GPT models to:

- Parse any job description.
- Extract critical job requirements:
  - Technical Skills
  - Soft Skills
  - Years of Experience
  - Educational Background
  - Demographic Preferences (if any)
  - Keywords for resume tailoring
- Provide actionable insights that job seekers can use to update or customize their 
resumes for better alignment.
- As our team have requested Real data with platforms like naukari.com and linked.in 
to come up with a more alligned open source model 
- once we will have them we will train our own model on cloud infrastructure (GCP).
---

## 🧠 How It Works

Under the hood, this app uses:

- `LangChain` for prompt management and chaining.
- `OpenAI GPT` model via `langchain_openai.ChatOpenAI` Just for now future plans are to 
come up with some dedicated models.
- A custom prompt template to extract structured data from natural language job descriptions.

2. Soft skills required:

   * Troubleshooting
   * Communication
   * Coordination with teams

3. Years of experience:

## 🛠 Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/resume-vs-jd-analyzer.git
cd resume-vs-jd-analyzer
````

### 2. Create a virtual environment

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create a `requirements.txt` file if not present, with:

```
langchain
openai
```

### 4. Set your OpenAI API key

You can either:

* Replace the key in `main.py` directly (**not recommended for production**)
* Or use environment variables (**recommended**):

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
```

Then, update the code:

```python
import os
openai_api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
```

---

## ▶️ Usage

Run the script:

```bash
python main.py
```

You can customize the job description directly in `main.py` under the `sample_jd` variable.

Would you like me to also generate the `requirements.txt` and `.gitignore` files, or even help you set 
this up as a Streamlit app or Flask API for web usage?
